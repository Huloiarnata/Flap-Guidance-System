# Flap Guidance System for Rocket/Missile using Raspberry Pi

## Project Description
This repository contains the source code and documentation for our college projectâ€”a Flap Guidance System designed for rockets and missiles. We've developed this system using a Raspberry Pi and a combination of a 3-axis gyroscope and 4 servo motors.

# Abstract

**Gyroscopic Control in Rocket and Missile Guidance**

Controlling the fins of a rocket or missile using data from a gyroscope is often referred to as "gyroscopic control" or "gyroscopic stabilization." Gyroscopes are devices that measure and maintain the orientation or angular velocity of an object, and they are commonly used in the control systems of rockets and missiles to help maintain stable flight and adjust the fins as needed.

**How Gyroscopic Control Works:**

1. **Gyroscope Data**: The gyroscope provides data on the rocket's orientation and angular velocity. This data is used to determine whether the rocket is deviating from its intended trajectory.

2. **Control Algorithms**: Control algorithms or software processes the gyroscope data and makes real-time calculations to determine if the rocket needs to adjust its fins to correct its trajectory.

3. **Fins Adjustment**: Based on the data and calculations, the control system can adjust the angle or position of the rocket's fins. These adjustments generate aerodynamic forces that help steer the rocket back onto its intended trajectory.

Gyroscopic control, combined with other guidance and control systems, can help rockets and missiles maintain stable and accurate flight paths. It is a common technology used in various aerospace and defense applications to ensure that the vehicle reaches its intended target or destination.


## Key Features
- **3-axis Gyroscope Integration:** The system incorporates a precise 3-axis gyroscope for accurate orientation data, crucial for precise guidance and stability.
- **Servo Motor Control:** We use four servo motors to control the flaps, allowing fine adjustments to the missile's trajectory.
- **Embedded System Design:** The entire system is built on an embedded platform using the Raspberry Pi, ensuring compactness and efficiency.
- **Future Objectives:** While our initial focus is on missile guidance, our long-term goal is to expand into object detection and tracking, making it applicable to broader scenarios.
