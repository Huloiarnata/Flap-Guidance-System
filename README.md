# Flap Guidance System for Rocket/Missile using Raspberry Pi

## Project Description
This repository contains the source code and documentation for our college projectâ€”a Flap Guidance System designed for rockets and missiles. We've developed this system using a Raspberry Pi and a combination of a 3-axis gyroscope and 4 servo motors.

## Key Features
- **3-axis Gyroscope Integration:** The system incorporates a precise 3-axis gyroscope for accurate orientation data, crucial for precise guidance and stability.
- **Servo Motor Control:** We use four servo motors to control the flaps, allowing fine adjustments to the missile's trajectory.
- **Embedded System Design:** The entire system is built on an embedded platform using the Raspberry Pi, ensuring compactness and efficiency.
- **Future Objectives:** While our initial focus is on missile guidance, our long-term goal is to expand into object detection and tracking, making it applicable to broader scenarios.

## Repository Contents
- Source code for the guidance system.
- Documentation for setup and usage.
- Data and diagrams for the 3-axis gyroscope and servo motors.
- Future development plans and goals.

Feel free to explore, contribute, or adapt this project for your specific needs. We welcome collaboration and aim to evolve this system for even more advanced guidance and tracking applications in the future.
